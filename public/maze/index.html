			The objective is to get from the top of the circle to the bottom.
			This maze is recursive, but the circle only exists on the top level of the maze.

		This maze was invented by the (clearly) brilliant Mark J. P. Wolf, and I found it 
		<a href='http://www.maa.org/editorial/mathgames/mathgames_11_24_03.html'>here</a>,
		and a couple of solutions <a href='http://www.mathpuzzle.com/18Nov2003.html'>here</a>.
		Like <a href='../snakes/'>snakes</a>, <a href='maze.js'>code</a> 
		and <a href='doc/'>documentation</a> is available.
		</p>
		These first two solutions come from the internet: a 
        <span class='solution' 
            name='long' 
            path='nnwswsnnswsnnswwnwseeneswwnwwwneswwnwses'>
			From <a href='http://www.mathpuzzle.com/18Nov2003.html'>here</a>. <br/>
			I like this solution because it uses all 3 immediate submazes 
			in their canonical order (they used to be labeled A,B,C clockwise from top left).
			Here's <a href='?path=nnwswsnnswwnwwseeneswwnwwsswwnwses'>another</a> one 
			with a simpler traversal through the first Red submaze.
        </span>
		and a <span type='button' class='solution' 
            name='short' 
            path='nnnwwnnsesnnswwnwses'>
			From <a href='http://www.mathpuzzle.com/18Nov2003.html'>here</a>. <br/>
			This is an easy solution to memorize: right through red, over to blue, 
			in red twice, unwind around, up and left, back into red, in-and-out to the bottom,
			and out.
        </span> one.
		Armed with this toy and a couple solutions, I set out to find my
        <span class='solution'
            name='first'
            path='neewwnnsesnnnwnnwnnes'>
			A good way of solving these is to pick a top-level path and just go for it.
			Identify sub-goals as you recurse in and the challenge becomes keeping track of
			which subgoal you're solving as you unwind.  With a little persistence, I believe most
			if not all paths are actually connected.  This solution is noteworthy because of the complexity
			of the red submaze's path compared that of the blue submaze.
        </span>
		solution,
		and a chai later I found my
        <span class='solution'
            name='second'
            path='nesssnnseennseseswwnwses'>
			I like this one because of the fairly even balance of complexity between the red and
			blue submaze traversals.
        </span> and
        <span class='solution'
            name='third'
            path='nnnwwnwseswwnwseees'>
			This path targeted the little roundabout on the east side of the blue submaze, which 
			had been unused (at any depth) in all my previously known solutions.  When I replayed this
			maze, I noticed that the path only crosses itself once, a trait also shared with the
			'short' solution from the internet.
			I hypothesized the existence of a non-crossing solution, 
			and I managed to find <a href='?path=nnnwwnwsswsnnnwnwswsnnswwnwwses'>one</a>.
        </span>.
		Then I
        <span class='solution'
            name='played'
            path='nnnwwnwwneswwnwswwswwnwwwnnwnnewnnes'>
			Long paths are long and fun.
        </span>
        <span class='solution'
            name='around'
            path='nnnwwnwsswwnwswwswwnwwwnnwnnewnnes'>
			Long paths are long and fun.
        </span>
		for a 
        <span class='solution'
            name='while'
            path='nnwswsnnswwnwseeneeswwnwseennseseswwnwses'>
			Another solution developed by picking a target and following it, in this case the
			green-line red-to-blue submaze connection.
        </span>.
		<span class='solution'
			name='Worst Path Ever'
			path='neewwnwseswwnwseeewwwswsnnswsnnnswwnwsesnnswsnnsweneswwnwwseeswwnwwwwnnwnwswsnnswsnnswwnwses'>
			Worst PATH EVER. (PAX East 2010)
